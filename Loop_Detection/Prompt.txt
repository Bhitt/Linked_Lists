Loop Detection:
	Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of
	the loop.

	Definition
		Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an
		earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.

	Example
		Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
		Output: C
Hints:
	#50: There are two parts. First, detect if there is a loop. Second, find where it starts.
	#69: To identify if there is a cycle, use the "Runner" technique.
	#83: If one pointer is moving twice as fast, they will collide. Where?
